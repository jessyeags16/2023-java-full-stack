/*
 * Encapsulation involves hiding class variables from other classes
 * 		we give them access only through getters and setters methods
 * 
 * getters and setters are needed in order 
 * to get the variable and set the variable
 * 		getters and setters have to be public.. to be seen by other classes
 *
